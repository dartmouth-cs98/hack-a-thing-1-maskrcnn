I tried to use MaskRCNN to analyze images and video from basketball games.

I learned about the pipeline that MaskRCNN uses and the ways you can customize MaskRCNN detection/improve performance of the model. I also learned how to combine object detection with the webcam feed  and how to play with the window settings.

I had a lot of trouble installing all the dependencies as some were out of date and/or had few help references online, but I eventually figured it out.
